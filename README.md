## üìñ Project Overview

The **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** replaces manual, paper-based claim processes with a secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital platform.  
It supports three main roles:

- **Lecturer** ‚Äì Submit claims, upload supporting documents, and track claim status.  
- **Programme Coordinator** ‚Äì Review pending claims and approve/reject them.  
- **Academic Manager** ‚Äì Oversee claim approvals and ensure compliance.  

This prototype (Part 2) uses **in-memory services** for data storage (no database yet), with a clean architecture that can easily be extended to use Entity Framework and SQL Server in later phases.
